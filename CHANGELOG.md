# Changelog

All notable changes to the codepilot1c-edt plugin are recorded here.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Add an entry under **[Unreleased]** for every notable change; on a release, rename
the section to the build/version and start a fresh **[Unreleased]**. Reference the
commit hash in parentheses where useful.

## [Unreleased] — branch `pd/bsl-tuning`

### connect_infobase — reliability (stack-polygon live findings)

- **Retry `setDefaultInfobase` once on a fresh association context.** (2026-07-02)
  Live-observed on EDT 2025.2.x: the FIRST bind into a new git-branch association
  context persisted the association file, yet the immediately following
  `setDefaultInfobase` threw "Project ... is not associated with infobase ..."
  (2/2 repro on fresh contexts; an external re-run of the connect always healed,
  because its adopt step re-read the by-then-visible association). `associate()`
  now does the same in place: short settle, re-adopt the persisted identity,
  re-`associate`, retry `setDefaultInfobase` once — a persistent failure still
  surfaces as `EDT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`. Regression test:
  `EdtInfobaseConnectSetDefaultRetryTest`.
- **Persist locally assigned infobase UUIDs back into the registry.** (2026-07-02)
  `IInfobaseManager.add()` can write the `ibases.v8i` row with `ID=null`;
  `persistReference` then assigned a UUID to the in-memory reference only, so every
  connect minted a NEW identity for the same infobase (three different UUIDs
  observed for one infobase across two workspaces and a restart) and per-branch
  associations in different workspaces diverged. All three assignment paths
  (post-`add()`, existing row with null UUID, force=true same-path reuse) now write
  the UUID back via `IInfobaseManager.update()`, best-effort. Regression test:
  `EdtInfobaseConnectPersistUuidTest`.

### MCP host — multi-endpoint profiles

- **Profiles are now shared across all plugin instances; only the port is
  per-instance.** (`e58ca92`, 2026-06-29) The profile set — name, tool set, bearer
  token, enabled flag — lives in a per-user file `~/.codepilot1c/mcp-profiles.json`
  (override with `-Dcodepilot.mcp.host.profilesFile` / `CODEPILOT1C_PROFILES_FILE`),
  so every instance/EDT installation of the same user sees the same profiles. Each
  instance keeps only its own port assignment per profile (InstanceScope key
  `mcp.host.profilePorts`); host-level settings (enabled/HTTP/bind/auth/mutation) stay
  per-instance. First load migrates the legacy per-instance profiles (or seeds the
  starter set) into the shared file and records ports. Note: the token now lives in
  the shared file in plain text (was EDT secure storage) — accepted for a
  loopback-bound host.
- **Per-tool picker in the profile editor.** (`e58ca92`, 2026-06-29) The CSV fields
  (enable/disable tools, disable groups, name filter) and the separate preview table
  are replaced by one checkbox tree (groups → individual tools with descriptions),
  with group-cascade tri-state, an "Announced tools: N" counter and a "≥1 tool"
  validation. The endpoints-table Port column is inline-editable (per-instance).
- **`discover_tools` answers strictly per calling port; live tool preview in the
  profile editor.** (`8aa63b6`, 2026-06-27)
- **Endpoints table UI** — add / edit / duplicate / delete / regenerate-token /
  copy-connection / check-status. (`8cf43ec`, 2026-06-26)
- **One EDT serves N MCP ports concurrently**, each a named profile with its own
  port, token and tool set (allowlist/denylist by group + per-tool overrides).
